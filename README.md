## Overview

This project utilizes various Python libraries to build a robust stock price prediction model. The model is trained on historical stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance, and predictions are made using a deep learning model. The user interface is created using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the model seamlessly.

## Features

- Fetch historical stock data using `yfinance`.
- Preprocess data using `numpy` and `pandas`.
- Build and train deep learning models with `TensorFlow` and `Keras`.
- Visualize data and predictions with `matplotlib`.
- Deploy the model with an interactive Streamlit app.

## Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: Efficient numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **yFinance**: Fetching historical stock data.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: Building and training deep learning models.
- **Streamlit**: Hosting the model on a web app.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
